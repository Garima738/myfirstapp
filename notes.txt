Scope and mutability
Blocak and function 

1) Let --> if we pack let in curly braces we cannot access it outside the braces
{let a=10,b=10;}
console.log(a+b);

reassignment possible.
block scope and mutable


2) var--->if we pack let in curly braces we can access it outside the braces
{var a=10,b=10;}
console.log(a+b);
reassignment possible.
global scope and mutable
allow hoistiong but throw undefined

3) const-->if we pack let in curly braces we cannot access it outside the braces
{let a=10,b=10;}
console.log(a+b);

reassignment is not possible.
const a = 10;
console.log(a);
 a= 20;
console.log(a); //throw error.
block scope and immutable


it can be mutable but reassignment is not possible in case of object and array

const person ={key:"Hello"};
console.log(person.key);
person.key = "Bye";
console.log(person.key); //execute successfully




Mutability--> 
hoisting --> when we use before it declaration


4) == and ===  
console.log(5=='5'); its chack value only number so it return true.
console.log(5==='5'); its check data type and reutrn false.



5)parameter simply a placeholder
 and 
argunment hold the actual value
